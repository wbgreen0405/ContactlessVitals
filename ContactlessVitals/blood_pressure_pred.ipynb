The calibration model maps the computed values to the ground truth sensor readings, thereby correcting for any systematic biases in the real-time outputs.\n","\n","We will build **two pipelines**:\n","\n","- **Pipeline with Gender and Race:** Uses computed signals along with all demographic features (age, height, weight, bmi, gender, race).\n","- **Pipeline without Gender and Race:** Uses computed signals and only the continuous demographic features (age, height, weight, bmi).\n","\n","This setup allows us to evaluate if including categorical demographics (gender and race) introduces bias or improves the calibration performance.\n","\n","## Data Preparation and Feature Selection\n","\n","1. **Data Cleaning:**  \n","   We begin by dropping irrelevant columns such as identifiers, metadata, and the raw `rPPG` column. The raw `rPPG` is a high-dimensional time series, and we are using already computed summary values instead.\n","\n","2. **Feature and Target Definition:**  \n","   - **Computed Features (Inputs):** `PTT`, `SBP`, `DBP`, `Heart_Rate`, `SpO2`, `Respiration_Rate`\n","   - **Ground Truth Targets:** `bps`, `bpd`, `pulse`\n","   - **Demographics:** `age`, `height`, `weight`, `bmi`, `gender`, `race`\n","\n","## Pipeline Construction\n","\n","The calibration model is built using scikit-learn. We use a `ColumnTransformer` to one-hot encode the categorical features (gender and race) in the first pipeline. The second pipeline only uses numerical features. Both pipelines use Linear Regression as a baseline regressor.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jFi56ZBF8PMX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":929},"id":"Escb_cm-GEUn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739916334594,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":201,"user":{"displayName":"William
